<h3>FAQ:</h3>

<p class="question">Why doesn’t the UC Davis Design Department not have focuses/tracks?</p>
<p>With all the fields of design that are quickly emerging, having a few focuses or tracks can be very limiting for design students now. Also, having a more open program allows students to explore different kinds of design without putting off graduation. It allows for a more personally tailored major for everyone in the program.<br /></p>

<p class="question">Why does the major start with a theoretical, foundational class like Design 1?</p>
<p>The UC Davis Design major is loosely based off of the Bauhaus school from the early 20th century. The Design 1 course is meant as a foundational course, introducing the basics of design thinking, design history, and a little bit of design practice. It’s an introduction so that people who might be interested in design can see if it’s something they want to pursue.</p> <br />

<p class="question">What is the purpose of Curriculum Navigator?</p>
<p>The curriculum navigator is designed to help students, new or otherwise, figure out what kinds of classes they might be interested in taking based on their design interests and tools or skills they want to cultivate.</p>
