	<p>
	I tried to take the user through the different kinds of flows they could have, based on whether the user was in need of a particular service or wanted to know what was available near them. <br />
	I would have liked the prototype to be more realistic, but I didn't think of things like folds that would enable a more interactive experience until I saw other people's ideas.

Presentation Notes:

analysis part of cycle:<br />

pointers:
-analyze user process from all roles (i.e. administrator versus customer use of a product)
-must come at analysis from multiple perspectives--delegate to different parts of the UX team (researcher vs designer) <br />

conflicting goals:<br />
	<ul>
	<li>see the big picture</li>
	<li>chunk the process</li></ul>

solution: flow model for big picture; work roles--divide and conquer <br />

Flow diagrams don't have be accurate. just start them early!! You will iterate them and that's okay. 
Flow should start as early as possible.<br />

after interviewing users, dissect the main points and recreate the interview. <br />

puts reality into theory--see what real life interactions with UI will be like <br />

GUYS PEOPLE MIGHT INTERRUPT. <br />

summarize and synthesize the raw data-don't quote verbatim--helps you process it. <br />

emphasize work roles when describing interviews--use "the buyer" versus "she" <br />

summarize interviews in small chunks that really get their main points across--needs, failure to meet needs, desires, etc <br />

categorize different kinds of user feedback: <br />
	- user and class info<br />
	-social aspects of work practice<br />
	-emotional and long term aspects<br />
	-task-specific info<br />

work activity affinity diagram <br />
	-theme-based is a good way to structure it<br />
	-combine with developing work-flow diagram<br />
	-very powerful<br />

have a BIG piece of butcher paper in your dedicated room<br />

don't dump feedback too early. You don't know what might be implemented later <br />

have the whole team build the wAAD together as a group, and piece by piece.<br />

play around ,and start to build a hierarchy of notes <br />

color coding papers for categories is an easy, clean visual language <br />

WAAD will give a fuller appreciation for user struggles and successes and contextualize them <br />

small and incremental process is a better way to report to higher-ups <br />

	Quick Prototyping; The Art of Scribbling Beautifully
	</h2>

	<p>
	Rapid prototyping is an informative experience. You realize that getting all that is in your head onto a piece of paper in a clear, but simple manner is hard. It's kind of like drawing out a movie of someone using your app. It's hard. My first attempt had my partner thinking that my app was just for ordering ride service around campus. Sod I added an extra section to broaden the understanding of my app on the next version. It gives you a new appreciation for the power of iteration. I got some cool ideas for what to do with the app if I had more time to expand its functionality. Partner feedback is invaluable-- they have that fresh perspective that I will not have, being so close to the nitty-gritties.

	<h2>2.4.16 <br />
	I Need Cargo Pants to Hold All This in My Pockets</h2>
		<p>
			Being animated? My pockets are. This was a fun little exercise. I feel like I'm finally mastering *some* things in jQuery. Slowly does it, right? <br />
		</p>
		<p>
			This interface, all said, gives me a new appreciation for how hard it is to just engineer good interfaces. My designer brain says "do this!" My programming brain says "oh, but so much CODE." But I digress.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think my use of color was good in this interface. I think
			the contrast is easy to see--complementary colors, anyone? I also think that my user interaction was decently intuitive. I think that clicking the image to make it disappear was a pretty intuitive flow. Overall, I'd like to make it more interactive in the future, but I think for a simple style, it served its function.<br />

	<h2>1.28.16 <br />
	Blog, Round 3: Facing the Day</h2>
	<p>
	 First of all, I must say that the hard part of this project was not the jQuery, but rather the CSS. Target practice is hard when there is no slack given for any sort of failure to execute. One wrong move, and my design will not do its job.<br /><br />
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 That all said, I think this interface is decently intutive. Roll over a face on the legend, and you see that category of activity. Roll over a time on the frame, and you see that time period. I think one element of my design that if viewers see it, it's a nice easter egg (i.e. not intended to be obvious in the design) that if you roll over the title, you see the whole schedule.<br /><br />
	 I wish there was a way to make my desire for the viewers to roll over the images and text in the first place more obvious. Perhaps if I designed them with a 3d, button-like look, it would be easier for them to intuit that they need to do something with those elements.<br /><br />
	 Overall, I would be happy to continue to pursue and refine this project if given the time.

	<h2>1.21.16 <br />
	Blog, Round 2: Form-alities</h2>
	<p>
	 One form I use a lot is the Gmail login form. It's a simple form, which agrees with Bill DeRouchey's article, Learning IxD from Everyday Objects. Simplicity is important. The colors make sense with user action or inaction. The greyed out text in "Enter your email" implies incompleted action, which is typical of online forms. Black text is what you see when you type, which is also consistent with current convention. However, the colors on the next button and the need help button are the same blue. Like the example in DeRouchey's article with the record button and stop button, where one has a positive connotation and the other a negative one, the blue here is confusing. The help button should have a different color, to imply that the user cannot continue, versus the next button, which implies the user can continue in the flow. Overall a good design, but it could use some changes to be more intuitive.<br />
