	<h2>Blog, Round 2: Form-alities</h2>
	<p>
	 One form I use a lot is the Gmail login form. It's a simple form, which agrees with Bill DeRouchey's article, Learning IxD from Everyday Objects. Simplicity is important. The colors make sense with user action or inaction. The greyed out text in "Enter your email" implies incompleted action, which is typical of online forms. Black text is what you see when you type, which is also consistent with current convention. However, the colors on the next button and the need help button are the same blue. Like the example in DeRouchey's article with the record button and stop button, where one has a positive connotation and the other a negative one, the blue here is confusing. The help button should have a different color, to imply that the user cannot continue, versus the next button, which implies the user can continue in the flow. Overall a good design, but it could use some changes to be more intuitive.<br />
