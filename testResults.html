	The audience testing was a real eye-opener on all the things that were working (and could use improvement) in my interface. I was using my interface in the ways that I knew would work, but the audience-testing literally tested every corner and bug in my interface and brought the holes into the limelight. <br /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	Luckily, the things that I thought worked did work and were pretty easy to find. Both testers were able to work the zoom function on the map, work the search function, use the legend, and go to the list of buildings index page. My users did not struggle to figure out what the function of my interface was. They both said it was pretty clear from the get-go.<br /><br />
	</p>
	<p>
	The issues they had were also pretty abundant. I didn't flesh out the whole map legend, so they expected all the features to be visible. There were also some technical issues when they tried to zoom at the same time as the legend was triggered. <br /><br />
